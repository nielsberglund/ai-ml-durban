<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a> has the pleasure of bringing you: <strong>Data and AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI</strong> as a follow-up event to the extremely succesful

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: April 2024</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day</strong> was held on April 27, 2024, at the stunning offices of <strong>BETSoftware</strong> in Umhlanga. Over 175 attendees attended, a record for a free Data and AI community event in Durban! The event was a tremendous success, with a fantastic lineup of speakers, engaging presentations, and a great atmosphere. Attendee feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing their excitement for future events. We can&rsquo;t wait to see you: <strong>Data and AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI</strong>.</p>
<p>So, what is <strong>Data and AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI</strong>? Microsoft recently introduced Microsoft Community Pilot. This initiative sees Microsoft supply slides and supporting demos to help anyone in the community quickly deliver a talk around topics important to Microsoft. The content is created by Microsoft but is free to reuse and remix to deliver to local user groups, meetups, and community events. As Microsoft intensifies its focus on AI, it is natural that AI would be the first topic for this initiative, hence <strong>Season of AI</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data and AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI</strong> is a dynamic, full-day, FREE, in-person event taking place on July 20, 2024 (location TBD). It promises an exciting, in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence and other hot topics in the realm of <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be many AI topics. Still, the event wouldn&rsquo;t be organized by 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a> if we didn&rsquo;t have a mix of other cool topics. So, expect topics along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure AI &amp; ML Services (obviously)</li>
<li>Generative AI</li>
<li>Database Development</li>
<li>Data Science &amp; Analytics</li>
<li>Real-world AI &amp; Data Use Cases</li>
<li>Streaming, Stream processing, Streaming databases</li>
<li>Power Platform &amp; Power Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though <strong>Season of AI</strong> is a Microsoft initiative, there will be topics covering non-Microsoft tech as well. The event will feature a mix of 60-minute and 20-minute sessions, with speakers from a diverse panel of experts, architects, and Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) who are all at the forefront of their fields.</p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re interested in <strong>Azure Open AI</strong>, eager to explore the latest in Generative AI, passionate about database development, fascinated by machine learning, or interested in the world of streaming, there&rsquo;s something for everyone. Our expert speakers are ready to share their insights and experiences, providing you with the knowledge and inspiration to propel your projects and career forward.
