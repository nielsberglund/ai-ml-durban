<h2 id="why-attend-the-durban-edition">Why Attend the Durban Edition?</h2>
<p>While the virtual event is fantastic, there&rsquo;s nothing quite like experiencing .NET Conf with your local community. Our Durban event offers:</p>
<h3 id="-local-expert-speakers">👥 <strong>Local Expert Speakers</strong></h3>
<p>Hear from South African .NET professionals, Microsoft MVPs, and architects sharing insights on .NET 10, C# 14, and real-world implementations</p>
<h3 id="-networking-opportunities">🤝 <strong>Networking Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>Connect with fellow developers, architects, and tech enthusiasts from KZN and beyond. Build lasting professional relationships within the South African .NET community</p>
<h3 id="-technical-sessions">🎓 <strong>Technical Sessions</strong></h3>
<p>In-depth presentations covering .NET 10&rsquo;s groundbreaking innovations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements and benchmarks</li>
<li>New language features in C# 14</li>
<li>Cloud-native enhancements</li>
<li>Cross-platform development advances</li>

<li>and so much more &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-panel-discussions">💬 <strong>Panel Discussions</strong></h3>
<p>Our Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban events are famous for their panel discussions. So expect engaging discussions with industry experts about .NET 10&rsquo;s impact on development, the future of the .NET ecosystem, and career growth in South Africa</p>
<h3 id="-completely-free">🎁 <strong>Completely FREE!</strong></h3>
<p>This community edition event is completely free to attend. Just bring your passion for .NET development and eagerness to learn!</p>
<h3 id="-be-part-of-history">🏆 <strong>Be Part of History</strong></h3>
<p>Be among the first to establish Durban&rsquo;s .NET conference tradition and put KZN on the .NET Conf map!</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p><strong>Wait, I&rsquo;m not a .NET developer&hellip; should I still come?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! While we&rsquo;re celebrating .NET 10, we know not everyone breathes C# (and that&rsquo;s okay, we still like you 😄). Since this event is organized by the <strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong>, we&rsquo;re mixing in other cool topics too. So if you think .NET is just a fishing tool or that C# is a musical note, don&rsquo;t worry - we&rsquo;ve got streaming data, real-time analytics, Python integrations, and cloud-native patterns that&rsquo;ll make your inner polyglot developer very happy.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: come for the .NET, stay for the streaming, or come for the pizza and accidentally learn something awesome! 🍕🚀</p>
<h3 id="topics--sessions">Topics &amp; Sessions</h3>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re interested in the latest .NET 10 announcements or want to explore the broader developer ecosystem, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.</p>
<p>As we finalize the agenda, you&rsquo;ll find it here. As mentioned above, the event is a full-day event, and in addition to awesome presentations, it will allow you to network with your peers.</p>
<h3 id="session-formats">Session Formats</h3>
<p>The event will feature a mix of session formats to keep things engaging:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>45/50-minute technical deep dives</strong> from local and international speakers</li>
<li><strong>15/20-minute lightning talks</strong> on specific features and techniques</li>
<li><strong>Panel discussions</strong> with Q&amp;A</li>
<li><strong>Networking breaks</strong> with refreshments</li>
</ul>
