<p>We, 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a>, want to continue our uber-successful <strong>Season of AI</strong> events, so we are proud to announce that <strong>Season of Agents</strong> is landing in Durban on <strong>May 24</strong>, 2025, in the guise of <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI â€” The Age of Agency</strong>. <!--We hope to host it again (thanks to **UNISA**) at [**Coastlands Umhlanga Hotel and Convention Centre**][3] in Umhlanga. --></p>
<h2 id="data--ai-community-day-durban-season-of-ai---the-age-of-agency">Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI - The Age of Agency</h2>
<p><strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI â€” The Age of Agency</strong> is our own take, plus more, on <strong>Season of Agents</strong>. It is a full-day, in-person event for the community by the community where we deep dive into the most exciting innovations in AI, data, and cloud technologies. It is packed with cutting-edge insights and networking opportunities and promises an exciting, in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence and other hot topics in the realm of <strong>Data</strong> &amp; <strong>AI</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3>
<p>Seeing the title of the event you can obviously expect topics <strong>AI Agents</strong> and how they act on their own, learn, interact with other agents, and adapt. As part of <strong>AI Agents</strong> you can also expect topics around the <strong>Model Context Protocol</strong> (MCP). The <strong>MCP</strong> is a new protocol that allows AI agents to communicate with each other and share information, enabling them to work together more effectively. This is a game-changer for the future of AI and will open up new possibilities for collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>However if you are not into AI Agents and/or think &ldquo;<em>my name is Bond, James Bond</em>&rdquo; when you hear the word agents, don&rsquo;t worry. Since the event is organized by 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a> we have a mix of other cool topics. So, expect topics along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Explore the transformative power of AI in content creation and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Database Development:</strong> Learn best practices and emerging trends in modern database management.</li>
<li><strong>Power Platform &amp; Low Code:</strong> Discover how to leverage low-code solutions for rapid application development.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning &amp; AI:</strong> Dive into the world of machine learning and its applications in various industries.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming Data &amp; Real-Time Analytics:</strong> Harness the potential of real-time data processing for actionable insights.</li>
<li><strong>Vibe Coding:</strong> Feel the vibe, dude! Explore the intersection of coding and creativity in the digital age.</li>
<li><strong>And Much More:</strong> Engage with a variety of topics that cater to all facets of Data &amp; AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though <strong>Season of AI</strong> is a Microsoft initiative, there will be topics covering non-Microsoft tech as well. The event will feature a mix of <strong>50</strong>-minute and 20-minute sessions, with speakers from a diverse panel of experts, architects, and Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) who are all at the forefront of their fields. At this event we will continue with the immensly popular panel discussion from last event where you can ask questions to the speakers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We are changing the format slightly. The &ldquo;long&rdquo; sessions will be 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes. This is to allow for easier scheduling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re interested in AI Agents, Azure Open AI, eager to explore the latest in Generative AI, passionate about database development, fascinated by machine learning, or interested in the world of streaming, there&rsquo;s something for everyone.
