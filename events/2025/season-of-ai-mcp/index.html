        <p>Data enthusiasts, AI innovators, and tech explorers — it&rsquo;s time to unwrap the gift of knowledge! <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI — Merry Christmas People (MCP)</strong> is happening on <strong>December 13</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>, and we&rsquo;re bringing you the perfect blend of cutting-edge tech and holiday cheer. 🎄✨</p>
<h2 id="the-story-behind-the-name">The Story Behind the Name</h2>
<p><strong>Season of AI</strong> is a quarterly Microsoft Community Pilot where Microsoft provides free content (slide decks, code, videos, etc.) for anyone to use at community events. This quarter&rsquo;s official theme is <strong>Season of AI - Model Context Protocol</strong>, focusing on how MCP is revolutionizing the way AI systems connect, communicate, and context-share.</p>
<p>But here at 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a>, we like to walk to our own beat! 🎵 Since we&rsquo;re hosting this event in December — right in the heart of the holiday season — we&rsquo;re calling it <strong>Season of AI — Merry Christmas People (MCP)</strong>. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to explore how Model Context Protocol is changing the AI landscape while enjoying the festive spirit that makes December special.</p>
<p>Think of it as our gift to the Durban tech community: world-class content with a local twist and plenty of holiday cheer! 🎁</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="following-up-on-ready-player-2">Following Up on Ready Player 2</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re riding high on the success of our October event, <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Ready Player 2 - Augment Yourself with AI Superpowers</strong>! That event was absolutely packed with 200+ attendees, incredible speakers, and enough AI knowledge to power a small neural network. The energy was electric, the hallway track was buzzing, and the panel discussion? Let&rsquo;s just say some spicy questions were asked! 🔥</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/collage-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Ready Player 2 - Augment Yourself with AI Superpowers</em></p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re closing out 2025 with another unmissable event. If Ready Player 2 was about augmenting yourself with AI superpowers, then Merry Christmas People (MCP) is about unwrapping the future of AI connectivity and context-sharing — with a festive bow on top! 🎀</p>

It&rsquo;s packed with cutting-edge insights and networking opportunities and promises an exciting, in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence and other hot topics in the realm of Data &amp; AI.</p>
<p>This event will feature a mix of <strong>50-minute deep dives</strong> and <strong>20-minute lightning sessions</strong>, delivered by a diverse panel of experts, architects, and Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) who are all at the forefront of their fields.</p>

Since the event is organized by <strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong>, we have a mix of other cool topics that celebrate everything Data &amp; AI. So, expect topics along the lines of:</p>
