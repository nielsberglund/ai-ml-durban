        <p>Data enthusiasts, AI innovators, and tech explorers, it&rsquo;s time to strip away the hype and get real! <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: AI Unplugged</strong> is happening on <strong>March 14</strong>, <strong>2026</strong>, and we&rsquo;re bringing you a full day of raw, authentic, community-powered learning. 🎸</p>
<p>We, 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a>, are kicking off 2026 the way we know best, with a packed house, brilliant speakers, and the kind of honest, no-fluff tech talks that have made our events one of the largest community-run tech gatherings in South Africa. 🚀</p>

<h2 id="following-up-on-merry-christmas-people-mcp">Following Up on Merry Christmas People (MCP)</h2>
<p>We closed out 2025 in style with <strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI — Merry Christmas People (MCP)</strong>! That event was the perfect way to end a record-breaking year: four Data &amp; AI Community Days and Durban&rsquo;s first .NET Conf, with nearly <strong>1,000 attendees</strong> across all events and <strong>65 speakers</strong> (many of them first-timers!). The MCP event delivered everything we promised: deep dives into Model Context Protocol, festive energy, a legendary panel discussion, and enough hallway track conversations to keep LinkedIn buzzing for weeks. 🎄🔥</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/mcp-collage.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI — Merry Christmas People (MCP)</em></p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the next chapter. If MCP was about unwrapping the future of AI connectivity, then <strong>AI Unplugged</strong> is about stripping things back to what actually matters: real knowledge, real skills, and real community.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="data--ai-community-day-durban-ai-unplugged">Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: AI Unplugged</h2>
<p>Think of it like MTV Unplugged, but for tech. No corporate polish. No death-by-slideshow. No &ldquo;AI will change everything&rdquo; hand-waving. Just real people sharing real knowledge with a room full of <strong>200+</strong> developers, data professionals, students, and tech enthusiasts who are hungry to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Data &amp; AI Community Day Durban: AI Unplugged</strong> is a <strong>FREE</strong> full-day, in-person event for the community, by the community, where we deep-dive into the most exciting innovations in AI, data, and cloud technologies. It is packed with cutting-edge insights and networking opportunities. It promises an exciting, in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence and other hot topics in the realm of <strong>Data</strong> &amp; <strong>AI</strong>.</p>
<p>We keep the friendly Durban energy, the slightly cheeky banter, and the <strong>serious</strong> technical depth.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p>From the title, you know there will be AI. But &ldquo;Unplugged&rdquo; means we go deeper, wider, and more honest than the hype cycle allows. Since the event is organised by 

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/azure-transformation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Azure, AI/ML &amp; Data Community Durban</strong></a>, we have a mix of topics that celebrate everything Data &amp; AI, and beyond. Expect topics along the lines of:</p>
<h3 id="-ai--machine-learning">🤖 AI &amp; Machine Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Agents &amp; Agentic AI</strong>: Multi-agent systems, orchestration, and real-world implementations</li>
<li><strong>Generative AI</strong>: LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and what&rsquo;s actually production-ready</li>
<li><strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>: Servers, clients, integrations, and use cases</li>
<li><strong>AI-Coding</strong>: GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Vibe Coding, how AI is changing the way we build software</li>
<li><strong>Small Language Models</strong>: Running AI locally and when you don&rsquo;t need GPT-scale</li>
<li><strong>Responsible AI</strong>: Bias, fairness, ethics, the stuff that actually matters</li>
<li><strong>AI for Africa</strong>: Unique use cases, challenges, and opportunities on our continent</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-data--analytics">📊 Data &amp; Analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Fabric &amp; Analytics</strong>: Data engineering, OneLake, lakehouses, Direct Lake, and business intelligence</li>
<li><strong>Database Development</strong>: Performance tuning, architecture, indexing, and modern database tech</li>
<li><strong>Streaming Data &amp; Real-Time Analytics</strong>: Kafka, Event Hubs, Spark, Flink, and data in motion</li>

<li><strong>DevOps &amp; Platform Engineering</strong>: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, GitHub Actions</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Because every developer and data professional needs to think about this</li>
<li><strong>Career &amp; Community</strong>: Breaking into tech, levelling up your career, building your personal brand</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Use Cases</strong>: Because theory is great, but practice is better!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though our events have historically been associated with Microsoft&rsquo;s <strong>Season of AI</strong> initiative, <strong>AI Unplugged</strong> stands on its own, and as always, we welcome topics covering non-Microsoft tech as well. The event will feature a mix of <strong>50-minute deep dives</strong> and <strong>20-minute lightning sessions</strong>, delivered by a diverse panel of experts, architects, and Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) who are all at the forefront of their fields.</p>
<p>The format is fast-paced 20-min lightning talks + 50-min deep dives. And yes, by popular demand (and a touch of infamy), the legendary <strong>panel discussion</strong> returns, ready to tackle your spiciest AI and data questions live on stage. 🔥</p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re passionate about <strong>AI agents</strong>, curious about <strong>generative AI</strong>, eager to explore <strong>data engineering</strong>, interested in <strong>database development</strong>, fascinated by <strong>.NET</strong>, or want to soak in the latest in <strong>Data &amp; AI</strong>, there&rsquo;s something for everyone. Our expert speakers are ready to share their insights and experiences, providing you with the knowledge and inspiration to advance your projects and career.</p>

<li>⏰ 50 minutes of pure student power</li>
<li>🎯 Showcase your work (5-10 minutes) to 200+ industry professionals</li>
<li>💼 Direct access to potential employers and mentors</li>
<li>🚀 Launch your reputation in Durban&rsquo;s tech scene</li>
